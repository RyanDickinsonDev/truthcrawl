# Threat Model (draft)

Primary threats:
- Sybil nodes (many fake observers)
- Collusion (cartels agreeing on false observations)
- Targeted manipulation (selective lies for specific domains)
- Replay/rollback (attempts to rewrite history)
- Legal/ethical risks (robots.txt, TOS, privacy)

MVP stance:
- focus on tamper-evident publishing and reproducible verification
- defer staking/slashing to later phases
