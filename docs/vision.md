# Vision

Search quality is an allocation of trust under adversarial pressure.

truthcrawl is a neutral substrate for publishing crawl observations with provenance:
- who observed
- what was observed
- when it was observed
- how confidence was derived

The goal is not to define “the truth of the web.”
The goal is to make claims about the web testable and to reduce narrative fog in SEO.
