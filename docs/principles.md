# Principles

1. Boring beats clever  
2. Deterministic beats convenient  
3. Verifiable beats persuasive  
4. Open infrastructure beats proprietary tools  

Rules implied by these principles:
- No hidden state
- No implicit ordering
- No reliance on library defaults
- No behavior without documentation

If a choice increases ambiguity, it is wrong.
