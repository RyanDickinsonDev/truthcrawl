# Contributing

We welcome contributions that improve:
- determinism (schemas, normalization, reproducibility)
- verifiability (proof systems, signatures, auditing)
- security (threat modeling, abuse resistance)
- minimal reference implementations

Process:
- Open an issue first for non-trivial changes
- Keep PRs small and testable
- Include docs updates when changing protocol behavior

Coding standards:
- Prefer boring, explicit code
- Deterministic serialization and hashing are non-negotiable
